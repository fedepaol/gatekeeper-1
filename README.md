# kubernetes-policy-controller

Kubernetes allows decoupling complex logic such as policy decision from the inner working of API Server by means of "admission controllers‚Äù. Admission control is a custom logic executed by a webhook. `Kubernetes policy controller` is a mutating and a validating webhook which gets called for matching Kubernetes API server requests by the admission controller. It uses Open Policy Agent ([OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa)) is a policy engine for Cloud Native environments hosted by CNCF as a sandbox level project.

## Status

This is a new project and is in alpha state.

## Using kubernetes-policy-controller

## 1. Deployment

Prerequisite a kubernetes cluster e.g. using ACS engine or AKS

Deploy `kubernetes-policy-controller`

```bash
./deploy/deploy-all.sh
```

Deploy sample policies

```bash
./deploy/deploy-admission-policy.sh
```

## scenarios

There are two scenarios of the policy engine namely Validation and Mutation

* Validation: "all resources R in namespace N are taged with annotation A"
* Mutation: "before a resource R in namespace N is created tag it with tag T"  

## 1. `validation` scenario

Load the policy as a ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl create configmap example --from-file ./policy/admission/ingress-host-fqdn.rego
```

```bash
kubectl create ns qa
```

The following call should fail with by policy

```bash
kubectl -n qa apply -f ~/opa/ingress-bad.yaml
```

## 2. `mutation` scenario

This policy will mutate resources that define an annotation with the key `"test-mutation"`. The resouces will be updated to include the annotation `"foo": "bar"`.

Load the policy as a ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl create configmap example --from-file ./policy/admission/annotate.rego
```

First create a Deployment:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image nginx
```

Check that the Deployment was not mutated:

```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx -o json | jq '.metadata'
```

Annotate the Deployment to indicate that it should be mutated:

```bash
kubectl annotate deployment nginx test-mutation=true
```

Check that the Deployment was mutated:

```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx -o json | jq '.metadata'
```

## create-policy

### policy language

The `kubernetes-policy-controller` uses OPA as the policy engine. OPA provides a high-level declarative language for authoring policies and simple APIs to answer policy queries.
Policy rules are create as a rego files. 

### package addmission

`kubernetes-policy-controller` defines a special package name `admission` which is uses to logically execute all the rules.
So any rule defined should be part of this package.

```go
package admission
```

### deny rule

Each violation of policy is a `deny` rule. So all we need to capture is all `deny` matches in order to validate.  
In the `policy` package any validation rule should be defined as special name called `deny`. In order to understand the basic idea lets consider a case where we want to create a rule which will block all API server requests i.e fail validation of all requests. The following models a that will always `deny` event

```go
package admission

deny[{
    "type": "always",
    "resource": {"kind": kind, "namespace": namespace, "name": name},
    "message": "test always violate",
}] {
    true
}
```

### matches[[kind, namespace, name, matched_resource_output]]  

While defining a `deny` rule finding resources that match a criteria is required, for instance if you are writing a violation for a specific ingress resource. kubernetes-policy-controller provides the matches funcationality by importing `data.kubernetes.matches`

```go
import data.kubernetes.matches
```

Here are some exampples of how matching can be used:

* Find matching Ingress resources  

```go
import data.kubernetes.matches

matches[["ingress", namespace, name, matched_ingress]]
```

* Find matching "ingress" resources in "production" namespace

```go
import data.kubernetes.matches

matches[["ingress", "production", name, matched_ingress]]
```

* Find matching "ingress" resources in "production" namespace with name "my-ingress"

```go
import data.kubernetes.matches

matches[["ingress", "production", "my-ingress", matched_ingress]]
```

Here is an example of a policy which validates that Ingress hostnames must be unique across Namespaces. This policy shows how you can express a pair-wise search. In this case, there is a violation if any two ingresses in different namespaces. Note, you can query OPA to determine whether a single Ingress violates the policy (in which case the cost is linear with the # of Ingresses) or you can query for the set of all Ingresses th violate the policy (in which case the cost is (# of Ingresses)^2.).

```go
package admission

import data.kubernetes.matches

deny[{
    "id": "ingress-conflict",
    "resource": {"kind": "ingress", "namespace": namespace, "name": name},
    "message": "ingress host conflicts with an existing ingress",
}] {
    matches[["ingress", namespace, name, matched_ingress]]
    matches[["ingress", other_ns, other_name, other_ingress]]
    namespace != other_ns
    other_ingress.spec.rules[_].host == matched_ingress.spec.rules[_].host
}

```

## patch rule

Patch rule allows mutation of objects.

### Example patch

```js
package admission

import data.k8s.matches

##############################################################################
#
# Policy : Construct JSON Patch for annotating boject with foo=bar if it is
# annotated with "test-mutation"
#
##############################################################################

patch[{
    "id": "conditional-annotation",
    "resource": {"kind": kind, "namespace": namespace, "name": name},
    "patch":  p,
}] {
    matches[[kind, namespace, name, matched_object]]
    matched_object.metadata.annotations["test-mutation"]
    p = [{"op": "add", "path": "/metadata/annotations/foo", "value": "bar"}]
}
```
